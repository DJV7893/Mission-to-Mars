# Mission-to-Mars

---
## Overview:
---
We created a Flask web application that scrapes data using Beautiul Soup and Splinter from an assortment of websites related to the Mars Mission that is stored on a Mongo database and finally displayed in a HTML web page. The data in our HTML web page includes: Latest Mars News, Mars Facts, a Featured Mars Image and full-resolution images of Mar's Hemispheres. After adding all the required data into our web application we altered the design to make it mobile-responsive and added two additional Boostrap 3 components to make it stand out.
